Copy this entire folder to be under your hw7 folder (i.e. it should be at hw-username/hw7/hw7-check).

Run `make compile_check` to check whether each class compiles. There are four compilation tests and you need to pass all of them.

Run `make test` to check if your BinarySearchTree and rotateBST pass the basic functionality tests. You should pass both GTESTs.

Run `make hypercube_test` to check if you hypercube pass the basic functionality tests. You can find the start node for each test in `hw7-check/start.txt`, permitted nodes in `hw7-check/permitted<X>.txt`, and expected output in `hw7-check/solution<X>.txt`.

Passing all compilation and functionality tests is not a guarantee of your score. However, failing any of the tests means you will likely lose significant points on the homework.
